            <p>I was gonna make this page talk about my favorite game, The Outer Wilds, but the color scheme provided doesn't match it's green forest/camp theme, so I'll talk about space itself instead. But yeah, space is so cool. Click the link to start learning about it!</p>

                <p>Did you know that the universe is constantly expanding and is currently expected to expand until everything is so far apart, it effectively dies due to a lack of heat? Another theory expects the universe to eventually stop expanding and start collapsing back in on itself.</p>

                <p>Did you know that not only is Earth rotating around our Sun, but that our Sun is moving our Solar System around a black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and that the Milky Way is moving across space as well? Lots of moving parts!</p>

It's a space exploration/mystery game, and it's literally a once in a lifetime experience.</p>

                <h3>Space Can Be Cool, But it Can Also Be Scary, Huh?</h3>
                <p>I know that so many of the facts you can learn about space feel almost existential, considering its scale and your place in it, how cold it is, both literally and figuratively, and that its end is inevitable, regardless of what theory ends but being corrct, but what the above quote from Outer Wilds shows is that the universe simply "is". It bears no ill will towards anyone, it's simply existing on its own terms and it's up to us, those who "are" to learn about it and love it as it "is". So, again, what are you waiting for? Click the button to learn more! Let's learn to love and understand the stars together.</p>

            <p>I was gonna make this page talk about my favorite game, The Outer Wilds, but the color scheme provided doesn't match it's green forest/camp theme, so I'll talk about space itself instead. But yeah, space is so cool. Click the link to start learning about it!</p>

                <p>Did you know that the universe is constantly expanding and is currently expected to expand until everything is so far apart, it effectively dies due to a lack of heat? Another theory expects the universe to eventually stop expanding and start collapsing back in on itself.</p>

                <p>Did you know that not only is Earth rotating around our Sun, but that our Sun is moving our Solar System around a black hole at the center of the Milky Way, and that the Milky Way is moving across space as well? Lots of moving parts!</p>

                <p>No fact here, I just wanted to shill for <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outer Wilds</a>, what I think is the greatest video game ever made, let alone one of the greatest works of art ever produced. It's a space exploration/mystery game, and it's literally a once in a lifetime experience.</p>
